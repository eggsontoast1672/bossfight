# bossfight

This is a refactored version of one of my oldest projects. I thought I'd share it on github just for fun. Feel free to do what you want with it, I don't care. I'm always looking to improve my code so if you have any suggestions just hit me up on discord at eggs#5175. Thanks for checking it out!

The project is based off of an old python project I made a long time ago. The mediafire link to the old project source code is linked below.

NOTE: This repository is no longer in development, but I'm keeping it around for a little while longer just in case. For updates, please see my other repository `dungeon-crawl`.
